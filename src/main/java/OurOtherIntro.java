//each program must have at least one class
//to be able to run
//a class is a blueprint of a concept
//holds all the information about that thing
//only one class per file may be public
//the public class name should match the java file name
//all code needs to be placed between the {} of the class

    //each program also needs to have at least one main method
    //execution starts in the main method and goes from top to
    //bottom, might make detours along the way

        //print messages to the console is one of the simplest
        //starts to learning programming
        //we print by using the System class
